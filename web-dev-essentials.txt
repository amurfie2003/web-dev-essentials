______________________________________
String Methods/properties to remember 
_____________________________________
toUpperCase()
toLowerCase()
substring() // extracts a part of a string
startsWith() // return true or false
endsWith()
includes()
trim()
split()
replace()
replaceAll()
Number.parseInt()
.length


_____________________________________________
Array Methods/propeties/concepts to remember
_____________________________________________
.push()//add to end
.pop()//remove last item and return item removed
.map() //return new transformed array
.filer() //return new array of items that passed condition
.reduce() //reduce to single value.reducer and initial value.Array unchanged.
.find() //return first item passed condition or undifined
.forEach() //iterate. HAS NO RETURN STATEMENT
.join() //turn to string
.reverse() //reverse
.every() //return true when all items meet condition else return false
.some()	//return true when atleast one item statisfies condition else return false
.splice(0 , 3) //remove from index exclusive. return removed item
.shift()// delete from front of list
.unshift('popcorn') //add to the front of the list
.length //returns number of elements in the array

=====QUICK CONCEPTS===================
[...items, apple] spread array. creates new array
const [a , b] = [] destructuring array
undefined returned for index that does'nt exist
myArry[0] = 'new item' will update array at that index
for (const fruit of fruits)//iterate array for-of-loop
======================================


________________________________________________
Object Methods/propeties/concepts to remember
________________________________________________
Object[] //dynamic key value
Object.keys(myObject) //returns array of keys 
Object.values(myObject) //returns array of values
Object.entries(myObject) //return array of arrays [ [key, value] ]
for (let creMember in crew) //iterate object key

=====QUICK CONCEPTS=============================================================
-let{a = 0 , b: c} = {} //destructuring and name reassignment and default value
-{...{}, ...{}} //spread object.Duplicate keys exist the last overwrites first
-return user.info?.name; //optional chaining short-circuit to undifined
 const firstValue = data.temperatures?.[0]; //optional chaining with array value
 const upperCasedName = person.name?.toUpperCase();//optional chaining method call
 Optional chaining cannot be used for assignment. It's only used for reading
-?? nullish coalescing operator
   return user.age ?? 'unknown'; //if left is null or undifined execute right
   const name = user.details?.name?.firstName ?? "N/A"; //combining both
-const copy = {...{}, darkTheme: true} immutable copy and add key/value
-const clonedUser = {...user, age: user.age + 1}; immutable copy and update age
-[object object] error // means toString() called on object instead of string
-use object to replace multiple if/else conditions
================================================================================

______________________________________
Classes
_____________________________________
the class constructor creates an object
internal method call with this.methodName() 
getters and setters validate values to be set as properties on the class
  set amount(value){
    this._cents = value * 100;
  }
  get amount(){
    return this._cents;
  }
use _ for internal properties
static methods are called on the class not the instance
static methods cannot access 'this' keyword
  static getYear(){

  }
method chaining - must retun 'this' to work
class inheritance (Child Extends Parent)
method override
Super(fName, lName, newVariable) (calls parent constructor and overides it)
super.parentMethod() 
constructor function and prototypes
all instance variables are part of the class object
#private field and method. only inside class useage. defined outside constructor
prototypical inheritance allows you to select methods you want to inherit
  GorillaBanana.prototype.eat = Gorilla.prototype.eat;
  extends simulates classical inheritance by copying all methods in the prototype
  Every object in JavaScript inherits the prototype of Object.
______________________________________
Promeses things to remember 
_____________________________________
Promises are used when doing asyncronous work
try...catch does not work with Promises
states: pending, resolved, rejected
promises.then(future callback).catch(error handling)
.finally(); //runs after .then or .catch 
throw new Error('there was an error') inside .then block skips to .catch() block
return new Promise( (resolve, reject) =>{ resolve(data); reject(error);});
  must return new Promise(); when creating promise
when you call resolve(); state changes to fulfilled .then() callbacked will execute
when you call reject(); state changes to rejected .catch() callbacked will execute



______________________________________
JSON 
_____________________________________
This is a JSON string not an object it needs to be converted into an object
  '{
      "firstName": "Sam",
      "lastName": "Green",
      "age": 24
  }'

  An APi cannot receive an object or send and object it must be a JSON string.
JSON.parse(string) //converts JSON string to JSON object
  This function is synchronous. This means that it will block the main thread. 
  .json() method is used by fetch() almost the same as JSON.parse().
JSON.stringify(object) //converts an object into a JSON string



_______________________________________________

HTTP 
_______________________________________________
status responses
1xx infomational responses
2xx successful responses
  -200 ok
3xx redirects
  -301 moved permanently
  -302 found
4xx client errors 
  -401 unauthorized
  -404 not found
5xx server errors
  -503 gateway timeout

methods
GET: read data
POST: create data
PUT: update data
DELETE: delete data

when sending a body to the api convert it to a json string.
 body: JSON.stringify({})


______________________________________
Fetch API 
_____________________________________
fetch('url string') //will send an ajax request and return a <promise>
resolving the <pronise> will return a generic Response object which needs to be converted into a specific format mostly json using .json() method which is non-blocking since it returns a new <promise>. Remember to return response.json()

These will not work
  const data = fetch("...").then(response => response.json());

let apiData;
fetch("...")
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    apiData = data;
});
console.log(apiData);

//You will end up getting undefined, that's because your code runs top to bottom and by the time console.log(apiData) runs, the promise is still pending. So the callback of the .then() has not run yet.

fetch will fail for network errors and execute the catch block but not for error responses. For most APIs, you can check if the response was successful by reading response.ok.

fetch also takes a second parameter for sending HTTP requests.
  fetch('url string', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      key1: 'value1',
      key2: 'value2'
    })
  })

ES Modules 
_______________________________________________
Every javascript file is called a module. Each module is seperate from other modules.
must use this format './helpers.js' 
  therefore file must be in the same folder.
imports must be at the top of the file before all other code(it is synchronous)
must use webpack or <script type="module" src="index.js"></script> for this to work
  
export class Helper{}
import {Helper} from './helpers.js' //named export

default export
---------------
  export default class Helper{} 
  import Helper from './helpers.js'
              OR
  export default class Helper{}
  import StringHelper from './helpers.js'
with default exports you can re-name them when importing them.The '{}' are also removed when importing. A default and named export can be used in the same module.Therefore this is valid
  import Helper, {votingAge} from "./helpers.js";

It is possible but not recommended to rename a named export as follows
  import {getDate as getDateHelper} from "./date-helpers.js"; 

When importing from a liberary the name of the liberary is used not the file path 



_______________________________________________

JS Concepts to remember 
_______________________________________________
ASI applies to let/const import/export and return
break; //used to force exit loop
continue; //skips an iteration of the loop
try...catch
reference types and mutability
  [] === []; //false
  {} === {}; //false
asyncronous javascript
callbacks - passing a function definition as parameter

typeof variable //returns the datatype of variable

let username = '';
let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';// short-circuit evaluation

comparing same value use a switch statement
switch('item'){
 case 'mango':
        console.log('mangoes are $1.50');
        break;
 default:
        console.log('invalid item');
        break;
}
_________________________________________________





 ____________________________________
Linux OS
_____________________________________
$ echo hello world (print to console)
$ echo "Hello Command Line" >> hello_cli.txt (create a new file named hello_cli.txt and add Hello Command Line to that file)
$ date (date)
$ whoami (username)
$ pwd (Print Working Directory)
$ cd (change directory) / is root
    cd .  (current directory). This is the directory you are currently in
    cd .. (parent directory). Takes you to the directory above your current
    cd ~  (home directory). This directory defaults to your “home directory” 
            Such as /home/amurfie2003
    cd -  (previous directory). This will take you to the previous directory you 
            were just at
$ ls (list directories) -a (all) -l(long) combine -la
$ touch index.html (create new empty file/update timestamp)
        touch home/user/index.html (create empty file at path)
$ cat hello-cli.txt (to print the contents of the hello-cli.txt file to the terminal)
$ mkdir new-folder (make directory in current directory)
        mkdir home/user/new-folder (make directory atspecific path)
$ rmdir (remove directory)

TAB-KEY gives auto completion 
UP/DOWN-KEY cycle previous comands

 ____________________________________
GIT
_____________________________________
git init //set up the project to be tracked by git

git add <filename>//adds files from the working directory to staging area so changes will be tracked by git.
  git add <filename> <filename> //adds both files at the sametime
  git add . //adds all files in current directory to staging area


git commit //changes from the staging area are permanently stored in the
  repository
  git commit -m "commit message"
    Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:
    Must be in quotation marks
    Written in the present tense
    Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m

  git commit --amend // update your previous commit.It’s important to note that although it seems like --amend is simply updating the commit, what Git actually does is replace the whole previous commit so will need a new commit message.

  git commit --ammend --no-edit //keeps the commit message


git status //gives the current state of the files example untracked files 
  this means that git sees the files but they are not being tracked must add them to staging area.

git diff <filename> //this will show the difference between working directory and the staging area. 

git log //This will list all the commits in chronloical order
  In the output:
    A 40-character code, called a SHA, that uniquely identifies the commit
    The commit author
    The date and time of the commit
    The commit message
  git log -s "keyword" //displays a list of commits that contain the keyword in the message.

  git log --oneline --graph //show a graphical representation of commits


git rm --cached <fileName> //deletes file from staging area

git show HEAD //shows everything in git log for HEAD commit  plus all the file changes that were committed. The HEAD is the commit you are currently on in most cases it will be le last commit.

git checkout HEAD <filename> //will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit. Use to undo mistakes.Must close and reopen file.
  shortcut: git checkout -- <filename> 
  does the exact same thing

git reset HEAD <filename> //Removes the file from the staging area.
This command resets the file in the staging area to be the same as the HEAD commit. It does not discard file changes from the working directory.
  output:
    Unstaged changes after reset:              
    M       file.txt

git reset <commit_SHA> //This command works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit. The HEAD is now set to that previous commit which will erase all commits ahead of the current HEAD position. The files are moved back to the staging area.

git stash //Running the command will store your work temporarily for later use in a hidden directory. Often used when you need to switch branches but do not want to 
commit the current code into the repo
  git stach pop //retrieve the stashed code

SETTING UP REMOTE REPO
git config --global user.name "Murphy" //sets your username for commits
git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com" //sets yor email 


____________________________________
HTML
_____________________________________
Attributes - key/value
href="#myid" - link to id on page

____________________________________
CSS
_____________________________________
css ruleset 
p{
  color: blue;
}
css inline style
<p style="color:blue; font-size: 20px;"></p>

type/element selector 
.class selector
#id selector
[src] OR img[src*='winter'] attribute selector

pseudo-class 
used for different states
p:hover {
        color: green
}

Specificity
1. id
2. Class
3. element

p {
  color: blue;
}
 
.main p {
  color: red;
}  //more spefic



chaining
h1.special {
 
}
The code above would select only the <h1> elements with a class of special. If a <p> element also had a class of special, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph.

Descendant Combinator
<ul class='main-list'>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
The nested <li> elements are descendants of the <ul> element and can be selected with the descendant combinator like so:
.main-list li {
 
}

Multiple Selectors
h1, 
.menu {
  font-family: Georgia;
}

!important
p {
  color: blue !important;
}
only used in extreme circomstances
